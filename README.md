# 🧠 Neuron

> Building something worth waiting for.

If you found this repository before launch, you're early.

Join the waitlist and you'll be among the first people invited when Neuron is ready.

</p>

**Run locally:** `docker-compose up` → open `/waitlist` at http://localhost:3000/waitlist

**Deploy publicly:** One-click [Deploy to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/yachitguliani/personal-assitant) — see [`docs/DEPLOY_WAITLIST.md`](docs/DEPLOY_WAITLIST.md)

> **Build Philosophy:** *"Computers adapted humans to software. NEURON adapts software to humans."*

NEURON OS is an open-source, AI-powered personal operating system inspired by cinematic sci-fi interfaces (like Jarvis and Iron Man's HUD). It is designed to act as a personalized intelligence layer for human life, functioning as a second brain, an AI chief-of-staff, and a proactive life assistant.

---

## 🌌 Core Pillars

1. **Second Brain & Memory Engine:** Seamlessly links discussions, tasks, and system notes into a semantic vector memory index for long-term retrieval and cognitive assistance.
2. **AI Orchestration & Chief-of-Staff:** Conducts streaming conversations, coordinates system tools, and processes background intelligence.
3. **Cinematic Cyberpunk Experience:** A premium holographic visual dashboard featuring glassmorphic controls, live telemetry status displays, and a real-time vector memory timeline.
4. **Modularity & Scalability:** Designed from the ground up for open-source extension, paving the way for multi-agent coordination, voice control, and mobile integration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Layout

NEURON OS is organized as a clean, modular monorepo:

```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js 14+, React, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas.
* **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy, Uvicorn.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with `pgvector` (semantic vector index), falling back to transient cosine similarity memory.
* **Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Python (3.10+)](https://www.python.org/)
* [Docker & Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional)

### Running Locally with Docker
To spin up the entire ecosystem (Postgres + Backend + Frontend) in one command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Running Manually

#### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
```

#### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
